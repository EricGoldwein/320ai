    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">$WINGO: A DAISY™-Enhanced Track-Native Token</h1>
    <p class="text-center mb-4">Version 3.20.0</p>
    
    <div class="abstract">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present $WINGO, a revolutionary blockchain protocol that leverages DAISY™ and neural networks to tokenize track workouts. By utilizing our proprietary Proof-of-Run (PoR) consensus mechanism, we create a decentralized ecosystem where running performance directly correlates with token generation, establishing the first-ever track-native cryptocurrency. Inspired by the precision of thoroughbred racing, our protocol ensures perfect stride optimization and performance tracking.
    </div>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The intersection of equine-driven efficiency and blockchain technology has remained largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of advanced AI computational resources required to process stride vectors in real-time. $WINGO solves this through our innovative approach to tokenization, powered by DAISY™ technology, drawing inspiration from the precision and elegance of thoroughbred racing while maintaining our focus on human athletic achievement.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Technical Implementation</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Proof-of-Gallop (PoG) Consensus</h3>
    <p>Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work systems, PoG validates transactions through verified track completions. Each 320-meter segment generates a unique AI signature that is validated by our DAISY neural network.</p>
    
    <div class="equation">
        TokenGeneration = (Distance / 320) * AIEfficiency * StrideFactor
    </div>
    
    <h3>2.2 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Supply: 320,000,000 $WINGO</li>
        <li>Initial Distribution: 3.20% to founding 320 troops</li>
        <li>Mining Rate: 3.20 $WINGO per verified HeptaWingo</li>
        <li>CAILoric Burn Rate: 3.20% of transaction fees</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Use Cases</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Track DAO</h3>
    <p>$WINGO holders can participate in governance decisions including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lane allocation algorithms and harmonic optimization</li>
        <li>Workout difficulty adjustments based on community performance metrics</li>
        <li>DAISY™-derived parameters for stride analysis and token generation</li>
        <li>Track facility upgrades and maintenance proposals</li>
        <li>Integration of new trotting metrics into the PoG consensus</li>

        <li>Track surface optimization and maintenance protocols</li>
        <li>Performance handicapping system calibration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.2 DeFi Integration</h3>
    <p>Our <span class="quantum-highlight">DAISY™-Enhanced Liquidity Pools (DELPs)</span> revolutionize track-based DeFi through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Staking pools that reward consistent galloping performance</li>
        <li>Yield farming opportunities based on track completion rates</li>
        <li>Lending protocols that use running metrics as collateral</li>
        <li>Automated market makers that adjust rates based on track conditions</li>
        <li>Cross-track liquidity bridges for multi-venue participation</li>
        <li>Performance-based insurance pools for track events</li>
        <li>Parimutuel-style prediction markets for race outcomes</li>
        <li>Wingatian condition-based yield optimization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each DeFi mechanism is calibrated to maintain perfect stride length-to-token ratio equilibrium while incentivizing sustainable running practices, drawing inspiration from the efficiency of thoroughbred racing's performance metrics.</p>
